> 🏛️ Experimental stack for ideology modeling

Bloc Bloc Bloc turns belief systems into executable logic.  
Instead of just debating ideas, models now simulate governance.

- ⚖️ Constitution-as-code  
- 🧠 Ideology-as-agent  
- 🧩 Collective decision trees and policy clash simulators

Each Bloc is a modular doctrine — tested through semantic friction.  
Powered by WFGY’s meaning-stable reasoning core.
